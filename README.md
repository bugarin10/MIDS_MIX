# Mix and Cocktail recommendation Engine üç∑üç∏üçπ

# Motivation

Our moto is the impact we can make in alleviating choice overload. This phenomenon, characterized by the overwhelming stress and indecision caused by an abundance of options, is a challenge many face daily. By developing a recommendation engine, we aim to empower individuals with personalized suggestions, reducing the cognitive load associated with decision-making and increasing satisfaction with chosen options. Let's drink and think in the conversation not on what to drink!

# Project Structure

This is the broad structure of the project and how we visualize is going to be merging all projects:

## Personal Cocktail Recommendation Engine
The first half of this project was to create a home-brewed cocktail recommendation engine. The engine was built using a dataset of cocktail recipes and ingredients. Using Pinecone, we were able to create a vector representation of each cocktail recipe and use cosine similarity to recommend similar cocktails based on user input. 

## Hugging Face Cocktail Recommendation Engine
The second half of this project was to create a cocktail recommendation engine using Hugging Face's model hub. For the same, we used a pre-trained model from Hugging Face's model hub to generate cocktail recommendations based on user input, namely, google-flan-large. 

# Deployment

For this individual one the project was deployed on Azure because doing it on AWS has not being explored yet, the website was https://midsmix.azurewebsites.net/ but it will be up just for the demo.
